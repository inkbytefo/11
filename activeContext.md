# Active Development Context

## Recent Updates

### Messaging Service Implementation (2024-02-15)
- Implemented real-time messaging with WebSocket
- Added end-to-end message encryption
- Implemented room-based and direct messaging
- Added message delivery status and read receipts
- Set up MongoDB persistence with Redis caching
- Implemented security measures and rate limiting
- Created comprehensive API documentation

### Authentication Service Implementation (2024-02-14)
- Implemented core authentication functionality with JWT
- Added user management features (register, login, profile)
- Set up secure password handling and validation
- Implemented refresh token mechanism
- Added role-based access control
- Created comprehensive documentation

## Current Focus
- Messaging Service is operational with real-time features
- Auth Service integration completed
- Security measures implemented for messaging
- Documentation updated for all implemented services

## Active Decisions
1. Using Socket.IO for real-time communication
2. AES-256-GCM for message encryption
3. MongoDB and Redis for message storage/caching
4. Rate limiting for message sending
5. JWT for authentication with refresh token pattern
6. Role-based access control for authorization
7. Message delivery status tracking
8. Secure logging practices established

## Next Steps
1. Integration with API Gateway
2. Voice Service implementation
3. Add automated tests for messaging
4. Set up monitoring for real-time metrics
5. Load testing for WebSocket connections
6. Security audit and penetration testing

## Known Issues
1. Need to optimize database indexing for message queries
2. Consider message archival strategy for old messages
3. Monitor Redis memory usage under load

## Technical Considerations
- Monitor WebSocket connection patterns
- Optimize message encryption performance
- Plan for message history archival
- Consider implementing message threading
- Monitor Redis memory usage
- Plan for database sharding if needed
- Consider implementing offline message queue
- Plan for scaling WebSocket connections
