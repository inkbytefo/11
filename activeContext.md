## Recent Updates

### Authentication Service Implementation (2024-02-15)
- Implemented core authentication functionality with JWT
- Added user management features (register, login, profile)
- Set up secure password handling and validation
- Implemented refresh token mechanism
- Added role-based access control
- Created comprehensive documentation

## Current Focus
- Auth Service is operational with core features
- Documentation has been updated with implementation details
- Development patterns and best practices documented

## Active Decisions
1. Using JWT for authentication with refresh token pattern
2. MongoDB for user data storage
3. Role-based access control for authorization
4. Password strength requirements implemented
5. Secure logging practices established

## Next Steps
1. Integration with API Gateway
2. Implement rate limiting
3. Add automated tests
4. Set up monitoring and metrics
5. Security audit and penetration testing

## Known Issues
None at present - initial implementation complete

## Technical Considerations
- Monitor token refresh patterns for optimization
- Consider implementing token blacklist for enhanced security
- Plan for user session management
- Consider implementing 2FA in future iterations
