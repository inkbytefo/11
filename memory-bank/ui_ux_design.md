# XCord UI/UX Design

This document outlines the UI/UX design for the XCord application. It describes the main screens, navigation structure, and basic components. This serves as a blueprint for creating visual designs using tools like Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch.

        *   Notifications (sound, desktop alerts).
        *   Privacy & Security.
        *   About (application version, credits).

## Navigation

*   **Sidebar:** Primary navigation for switching between channels and direct messages.
*   **Top Navigation:** Secondary navigation for application-wide actions (search, notifications).
*   **Contextual Menus:** Right-click menus for specific actions on messages, channels, or users.

## Components

*   **Buttons:**
    *   Primary button style (e.g., filled, brand color).
    *   Secondary button style (e.g., outlined, neutral color).
    *   Icon buttons (e.g., for send, attach, settings).

*   **Input Fields:**
    *   Text input fields (for messages, search, channel names).
    *   Password input fields (with visibility toggle).

*   **Chat Area:**
    *   Message bubbles (with user avatar, timestamp, and message content).
    *   Different styles for own messages and messages from other users.

*   **Avatars:**
    *   Circular or rounded square images representing users.

*   **Status Indicators:**
    *   Small icons or colored dots indicating user online/offline/away status.

*   **Loading Indicators:**
    *   Spinners or progress bars to indicate loading states.

* **Modals/Dialogs:**
    * For creating channels, confirming actions, displaying detailed information.

## Design Considerations

*   **Dark Mode Support:** Design should be adaptable to both light and dark themes.
*   **Accessibility:** Adhere to accessibility guidelines (WCAG) for color contrast, font sizes, and keyboard navigation.
*   **Responsiveness:** Design should be adaptable to different screen sizes (although this is a desktop application, consider potential window resizing).
*   **Consistency:** Maintain consistent styling and layout across all screens.
*   **User Experience:** Prioritize a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly interface.

This document provides a starting point for the UI/UX design. A visual design created in Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch will further refine these concepts and provide a complete visual representation of the application.
